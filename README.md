# GenerativeAdversarialNetworks
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning models that have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in the domain of generative modeling. GANs were introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014
GANs are commonly used for generating realistic images. They can learn from a training dataset and generate new images that resemble the training data.
